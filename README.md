# Tales of Rathnir

Private build of the Tales of Rathnir mod for **EU4 1.34.5**.

## Introduction

Tales of Rathnir is a **fantasy total conversion mod** for Europa Universalis 4 based on the world of Rathnir. Its goal is to combine new and innovative gameplay systems, mechanics and content with a creative alternate history setting for Rathnir and, in doing so, to create a fun and fresh Europa Universalis experience!

## Getting Started

### Downloading
To download this repository, hit the green "**<> Code**" button above the directory list and click "Download ZIP".

### Adding this build to the modlist

EU4's files are normally spread across 2 distinct folders: one in your steam files, which is used to store your copy of the game; and one in your Documents folder, used to store user-related files, such as save games, crash logs and, most importantly, **mods**.

To add this build to your modlist, go to the following directory:

```
Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis 4/mods
```

and paste in the zipped build file. Then, unzip it and pull the "descriptor.mod" file out onto the mods folder. If necessary, rename the .mod file to "rathnir-main.mod" so as to match the folder.

At this point, you should have at least two things in your /mod folder:
* the "**rathnir-main**" folder;
* the "**rathnir-main.mod**" file;

### Launching EU4

If everything checks out, delete the .zip file and start up EU4. When modifying a playset, you should now see an icon-less "Rathnir-LocalFork" mod pop up. Add it to your playset, switch to that playset and hit **Play**!
