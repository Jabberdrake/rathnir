# Tales of Rathnir

Private build of the Tales of Rathnir mod for **EU4 1.34.5**.

## Introduction

Tales of Rathnir is a **fantasy total conversion mod** for Europa Universalis 4 based on the world of Rathnir. Its goal is to combine new and innovative gameplay systems, mechanics and content with a creative alternate history setting for Rathnir and, in doing so, to create a fun and fresh Europa Universalis experience!

## Getting Started

### Downloading
To download this repository, hit the green "**<> Code**" button above the directory list and click "Download ZIP".

### Adding this build to the modlist

EU4's files are normally spread across 2 distinct folders: one in your steam files, which is used to store your copy of the game; and one in your Documents folder, used to store user-related files, such as save games, crash logs and, most importantly, **mods**.

To add this build to your modlist, go to the following directory:

```
Documents/Paradox Interactive/Europa Universalis 4/mods
```

and paste in the zipped build file. Then, unzip it and pull the "rathnir.mod" file out onto the mods folder. If necessary, rename the build folder to "rathnir" so as to match the .mod file.

At this point, you should have at least two things in your mods folder:
* the "**rathnir**" folder;
* the "**rathnir.mod**" file;

### Launching EU4

If everything checks out, delete the .zip file and start up EU4. When modifying a playset, you should now see an icon-less "Rathnir" mod pop up. Add it to your playset, switch to that playset and hit **Play**!
