 grain:0 "Grain"
 grainDESC:0 "Grain represents the vegetable foodstuff that was the staple diet for humans and animals. Lack of it would always lead to revolts and riots.

Colonial expansion into Akan'nash was in part to secure supplies of such vital goods."
 salt:0 "Salt"

 wine:0 "Wine"

 silk:0 "Silk"
 silkDESC:0 "The finest of all fabrics of the west was the silk produced in Talawa, Nandór and Aruna.

 incense:0 "Incense"
 incenseDESC:0 "To spread smoke and fragrance through the burning of materials has been common in ceremonial practices for centuries.
