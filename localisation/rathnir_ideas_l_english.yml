 A07_flexible_treaties:0 "Flexible Treaties"
 A07_flexible_treaties_desc:0 "Coltmaere exists in an eternal dance with death. Surrounded by stronger powers, Coltmaere survives in a constant state of signing and resigning treaties to keep foreign powers' eyes off of us."
 A07_a_yellow_memory:0 "A Yellow Memory"
 A07_a_yellow_memory_desc:0 "Despite our estrangement, the people of Coltmaere are closely related to the Bardonians and Ryzani. Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from their warrior spirit..."

 A07_hjuzairar:0 "Hjuzairar"

 A07_iceshapers:0 "Iceshapers"
 A07_iceshapers_desc:0 "Keshnev's ice shapers are strange indeed. They turn summer heat into winter snow, and claim to see the future in the ice... Despite our nominal ban on witchcraft, it may be wise to sanction their divination practices."
